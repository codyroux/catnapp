# catnapp
the Categorical Nearly Automatic Property Prover

This Haskell program is designed to assist the working category theorist with 2 tasks:

1. Building maps between objects in various categories
2. Proving equalities between those maps

To do this, we apply standard techniques from theorem proving and rewriting theory.

Right now, this program is mostly a stub, but we hope to extend it (and document it!) further in the near future.
